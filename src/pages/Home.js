        <p>Easy Growin' Water Gardens is Michigan's premier aquatic nursery. We grow over 200 different aquatic species with new introductions yearly. Some of these are rare and unusual. Although we grow a variety of different plants including hardy bamboo, cactus, grasses, and ground cover. Easy Growin' specializes in plants for water gardens, bogs, and rain gardens. To help serve the needs of gardeners, Easy Growin' not only provides plants and needed supplies for water gardening, but also offers free information and advice. Easy Growin' will be glad to host a club outing or tour of our facilities and will offer free water gardening workshops/classes at our site.</p>
        <p>Our nursery is located just north of Flint, approximately 1 hour from Detroit. For further directions see the services page. Customer satisfaction coupled with our unique setting and services makes the trip well worth the drive.</p>
